AUTOTAX,"
              AUTOTAX 1 causes the unit to attempt to tax every turn (without
              requiring the TAX order) until the flag is unset. AUTOTAX 0
              unsets the flag.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              To cause the unit to attempt to tax every turn.

            "
AVOID,"
              AVOID 1 instructs the unit to avoid combat wherever possible.
              The unit will not enter combat unless it issues an ATTACK order,
              or the unit's faction is attacked in the unit's hex. AVOID 0
              cancels this.
            
            
              The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive; setting
              one automatically cancels the other.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Set the unit to avoid combat when possible.
            
            
              
            
            AVOID 1
            "
BEHIND,"
              BEHIND 1 sets the unit to be behind other units in combat. 
              BEHIND 0 cancels this.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Set the unit to be in front in combat.
            
            
              
            
            BEHIND 0
            "
GUARD,"
              GUARD 1 sets the unit issuing the order to prevent non-Friendly
              units from collecting taxes in the region, and to prevent any
              units not your own from pillaging the region.  Guarding units
              will also attempt to prevent Unfriendly units from entering the
              region.  GUARD 0 cancels Guard status.
            
            
              The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive; setting
              one automatically cancels the other.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Instruct the current unit to be on guard.
            
            
              
            
            GUARD 1
            "
HOLD,"
              HOLD 1 instructs the issuing unit to never join a battle in
              regions the unit is not in.  This can be useful if the unit is
              in a building, and doesn't want to leave the building to join
              combat. HOLD 0 cancels holding status.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Instruct the unit to avoid combat in other regions.
            
            
              
            
            HOLD 1
            "
NOAID,"
              NOAID 1 indicates that if the unit attacks, or is attacked, it
              is not to be aided by units in other hexes. NOAID status is very
              useful for scouts or probing units, who do not wish to drag
              their nearby armies into battle if they are caught. NOAID 0
              cancels this.
            
            
              If multiple units are on one side in a battle, they must all
              have the NOAID flag on, or they will receive aid from other
              hexes.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Set a unit to receive no aid in battle.
            
            
              
            
            NOAID 1
            "
NOCROSS,"
              NOCROSS 1 indicates that if a unit attempts to cross a body of
              water then that unit should instead not cross it, regardless of
              whether the unit otherwise could do so. Units inside a fleet are
              not affected by this flag (IE, they are able to sail within the
              fleet). This flag is useful to prevent scouts from accidentally
              drowning when exploring in games where movement over water is
              allowed. NOCROSS 0 cancels this.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Set a unit to not permit itself to cross water.
            
            
              
            
            NOCROSS 1
            "
SHARE,"
              SHARE 1 instructs the unit to share its possessions with any
              other unit of your faction that needs them.  Thus a unit with a
              supply of silver could automatically provide silver if any of
              your other units in the same region does not have enough to
              perform an action, such as studying, buying or producing. 
              SHARE 0 returns a unit to its default selfish state.
            
            
              This sharing does not extend to the heat of battle, only to
              economic actions.  So a unit that is sharing will provide silver
              for buying or studying, and resources for production (for
              example, if a sharing unit has wood in its inventory, and
              another unit is producing axes but has no wood, then the sharing
              unit will automatically supply wood for that production), but
              will not provide weapons to all units if combat occurs.
            
            
              Note that in the case of sharing silver, this can leave the
              sharing unit without enough funds to pay maintenance, so sharing
              is to be used with care.  You may like to make sure that there
              is a unit with sufficient funds for maintenance in the same
              region, and which is not sharing, as those funds will be shared
              for maintenance, but not for less important purposes.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Instruct the unit to share its possessions with other units of
              the same faction.

            "
SPOILS,"
              The SPOILS order determines which types of spoils the unit
              should take after a battle.  The valid values for type are
              'NONE', 'WALK', 'RIDE', 'FLY', 'SWIM', 'SAIL' or 'ALL'. The
              second form is equivalent to 'SPOILS ALL'.
            
            
              When this command is issued, the unit is instructed to only pick
              up combat spoils if they could use the chosen form of movement
              while carrying the spoils. Thus a unit with SPOILS FLY selected
              would pick up combat spoils until they reached their flying
              capacity.  If the spoils provide movement capacity themselves,
              this will be included in the decision of whether or not to take
              the spoils - so a unit with SPOILS RIDE would always pick up
              horses. SPOILS SAIL will use the capacity of the fleet the unit
              is in to determine whether to take spoils or not. SPOILS ALL
              will allow a unit to collect any spoils which are dropped
              regardless of weight or capacity. SPOILS NONE will instruct the
              unit to only collect weightless items, such as silver.
            
            
              Example:
            
            
              Set a unit to only pick up items that it can carry and continue
              to fly:
            
            
              
            
            SPOILS FLY
